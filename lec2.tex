\frametitle{Introduction}
In realtime systems threads have two distinct functions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Endless loops with blocking I/O or GPIO wakeups
  to establish \textbf{precise timing} for callbacks.
\item \textbf{Asynchronous execution} of time-consuming tasks
  with a callback after the task has completed.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Thread and worker}
A thread is just a \textsl{wrapper} for the actual method
which is running independently. The method being run in the thread
is often called a \textsl{worker}.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Creating threads}
In C++ a worker is a method within
a class:
\begin{verbatim}
uthread = new std::thread(&MyClassWithAThread::run, this);
\end{verbatim}
where \texttt{MyClassWithAThread} is a class containing the method ``run'':
\begin{verbatim}
class MyClassWithAThread {
        void run() {
                // ... hard work is done here
                doCallback(result); // hand the result over
        }
}
\end{verbatim}
Note that the \& signifies a functor. You can also use a lambda function:
\begin{verbatim}
uthread = std::thread([this](){run();});
\end{verbatim}

\end{frame}

\frametitle{Lifetime of a thread}
Threads terminate simply once the worker has finished its job.
To wait for the termination
of the thread use the ``join()'' method:
\begin{verbatim}
        void stop() {
                uthread->join();
                delete uthread;
        }
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Running/stopping workers with endless loops}
Threads with endless loops are often used in conjunction with blocking
I/O which provide the timing:
\begin{verbatim}
void run() {
       running = true;
       while (running) {
              read(buffer); // blocking
              doCallback(buffer); // hand data to client
       }
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Running/stopping workers with endless loops}
Note the flag \texttt{running} which is controlled by the main program and is set to zero to terminate
the thread:
\begin{verbatim}
        void stop() {
                running = false; // <----- HERE!!
                uthread->join();
                delete uthread;
        }
\end{verbatim}
Note that \texttt{join()} is a blocking operation and needs to be used with care not to
lock up the main program. You probably only need it when your program is terminating.
See \url{https://github.com/berndporr/rpi_AD7705_daq} for an example.

\frametitle{Timing within threads: Timing with blocking I/O}

In this example the blocking \texttt{read} command creates
the timing of the callback:
\begin{verbatim}
void run() {
       running = 1;
       while (running) {
              read(buffer); // blocking
              doCallback(buffer); // hand data to client
       }
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Timing with Linux/pigpio timers}
As a last resort one can use a timer. Similar to threads one can
create timers which are then called at certain intervals. As with threads
timers should be \textsl{hidden} within a C++ class as
\textsl{private} members which then trigger \textsl{public callbacks}
via C++ callback mechanisms as described above.

Generally it's \textsl{not recommended}
to use timers for anything which needs to be reliably sampled, for
example ADC converters or sensors with sampling rates higher than a
few Hz. On the raspberry PI use the pigpio library and its timer
callbacks --- if needed at all.
