Threads
</H1>

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION00410000000000000000">
Introduction</A>
</H1>
In realtime systems threads have two distinct functions:

<OL>
<LI>Endless loops with blocking I/O or GPIO wakeups
  to establish <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">precise timing</SPAN> for callbacks.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Asynchronous execution</SPAN> of time-consuming tasks
  with a callback after the task has completed.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION00420000000000000000">
Processes and Threads</A>
</H1>
Processes are different programs which seem to be running at the same
time. A small embedded system may only have a single CPU core,
so this this is achieved by the operating system switching
approximately every 10ms from one process to the next so it feels as
if they are running concurrently. A thread is a lightweight
process. A process may have  multiple threads which share the same
address-space and are all started from
within the parent process. As with processes, the threads seem to be
running at the same time. When a thread is started it runs
simultaneously with the main process which created it.

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION00430000000000000000">
Thread and worker</A>
</H1>
A thread is just a <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">wrapper</SPAN> for the actual method
which is running independently. The method being run in the thread
is often called a <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">worker</SPAN>.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00431000000000000000">
Creating threads</A>
</H2>
In C++ a worker is a method within
a class and needs to be <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">static</SPAN> which means it won't be
able to access the instance variables of a class. The trick
is to pass a pointer to the instance of the class (<SPAN  CLASS="texttt">this</SPAN>) as the argument of
the worker, in the following example called <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">exec</SPAN>:
<PRE>
uthread = new std::thread(MyClassWithAThread::exec, this);
</PRE>
where <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">MyClassWithAThread</SPAN> is a class containing the static function &ldquo;exec&rdquo;:
<PRE>
class MyClassWithAThread {
        void run() {
                // ... hard work is done here
                doCallback(result); // hand the result over
        }
        static void exec(MyClassWithAThread* cppThread) {
                cppThread-&gt;run();
        }
}
</PRE>
which in turn then calls a non-static class method <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">run()</SPAN>.
<SPAN  CLASS="texttt">run</SPAN> will then have access to all of the instance's attributes
and methods.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00432000000000000000">
Lifetime of a thread</A>
</H2>
Threads terminate simply once the static worker has finished its job.
To tell the client that a thread has finished you can use a
<SPAN  CLASS="textsl">callback</SPAN> to trigger an event.

<P>
Sometimes it's important to wait for the termination of the thread,
for example when your whole program is terminating or when
you stop an endless loop in a thread. To wait for the termination
of the thread use the &ldquo;join()&rdquo; method:
<PRE>
        void stop() {
                uthread-&gt;join();
                delete uthread;
        }
</PRE>
It's also important is also to release the memory of a thread after it has finished
to avoid memory leaks, hence the <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">delete</SPAN> command.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00433000000000000000">
Running/stopping workers with endless loops</A>
</H2>
Threads with endless loops are often used in conjunction with blocking
I/O which provide the timing:
<PRE>
void run() {
       running = true;
       while (running) {
              read(buffer); // blocking
              doCallback(buffer); // hand data to client
       }
}
</PRE>
Note the flag <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">running</SPAN> which is controlled by the main program and is set to zero to terminate
the thread:
<PRE>
        void stop() {
                running = false; // &lt;----- HERE!!
                uthread-&gt;join();
                delete uthread;
        }
</PRE>
Note that <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">join()</SPAN> is a blocking operation and needs to be used with care not to
lock up the main program. You probably only need it when your program is terminating.
See <kbd><A ID="tex2html17"
  HREF="https://github.com/berndporr/rpi_AD7705_daq">https://github.com/berndporr/rpi_AD7705_daq</A></kbd> for an example.

<P>
If your program creates and joins several threads while executing,
with care you might be able to design your program to allow an
end-of-life thread to carry on
tidying up in the background after you stop it by setting <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">running = false;</SPAN>.
In this case only need execute <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">join()</SPAN> to be sure that
the thread has finished. Joining a terminated thread is OK
(the call just returns immediately)
but you absolutely  must not join a thread more than once,
nor delete a thread until you've joined it.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00434000000000000000">
Timing within threads</A>
</H2>
Threads are perfect to create timing without using sleep commands
with the help of <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">blocking I/O</SPAN>.

<P>

<H3><A ID="SECTION00434100000000000000">
select/poll commands waiting for GPIO interrupts</A>
</H3>
In section&nbsp;<A HREF="node3.html#gpioIRQ">2.2.3</A> we introduced the so called &ldquo;poll&rdquo; command
which is not polling an IRQ pin but <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">putting a thread to sleep</SPAN> till an
external event has happened. Then of course a callback function should
be called reacting to the external event. This is the preferred method
for low latency responses.

<P>
As said previously, use <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">pigpio</SPAN> on the Raspberry PI
which wraps the select/poll commands into a thread and calls a
<SPAN  CLASS="textsl">callback</SPAN> function whenever an GPIO pin has been triggered.

<P>

<H3><A ID="SECTION00434200000000000000">
Timing with blocking I/O</A>
</H3>
Blocking I/O (read, write, etc) <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">is by far the best approach</SPAN> to time
the data coming in because the thread goes to sleep when it's waiting for
I/O but wakes up very quickly after new data has arrived.

<P>
In this example the blocking <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">read</SPAN> command creates
the timing of the callback:
<PRE>
void run() {
       running = 1;
       while (running) {
              read(buffer); // blocking
              doCallback(buffer); // hand data to client
       }
}
</PRE>

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION00440000000000000000">
Timing with Linux/pigpio timers</A>
</H1>
As a last resort one can use a timer. Similar to threads one can
create timers which are then called at certain intervals. As with threads
timers should be <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">hidden</SPAN> within a C++ class as
<SPAN  CLASS="textsl">private</SPAN> members which then trigger <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">public callbacks</SPAN>
via C++ callback mechanisms as described above. These timers emit a
Linux signal at a specified interval and then this signal is caught by
a global (static) function.  Generally it's <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">not recommended</SPAN>
to use timers for anything which needs to be reliably sampled, for
example ADC converters or sensors with sampling rates higher than a
few Hz. On the raspberry PI use the pigpio library and its timer
callbacks &mdash; if needed at all.

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION00450000000000000000">
Conclusion</A>
</H1>
Threads play a central role in real-time coding as,
together with blocking I/O, they establish
the callback interfaces. Every event handler
runs in a separate thread.

<P>
Callbacks are also used to signal the termination of
threads, which shows again the close relationship between threads
and callbacks.
