Threads</A>
</H1>

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION00410000000000000000">
Introduction</A>
</H1>
In realtime systems threads have two distinct functions:

<OL>
<LI>Endless loops with blocking I/O or GPIO wakeups
  to establish <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">precise timing</SPAN> for callbacks.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Asynchronous execution</SPAN> of time consuming tasks
  with a callback after the task has completed.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION00420000000000000000">
Processes and Threads</A>
</H1>
Processes are different programs which seem to be running at the same
time. However this is done by the operating system which switches
approximately every 10ms from one process to the next so it feels as
if they are running at the same time. A thread is a lightweight
process where multiple threads share the same memory and started from
within the parent process. As with processes the threads seem to be
running at the same time. When a thread is started it runs
simultaneously to the main process which created it.

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION00430000000000000000">
Thread and worker</A>
</H1>
A thread is just a <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">container</SPAN> for the actual method
which is running independently. The method contained inside of a
thread is often called <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">worker</SPAN>.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00431000000000000000">
Creating threads</A>
</H2>
In C++ a worker is a method within
a class and needs to be <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">static</SPAN> which means it won't be
able to access the instance variables of a class. The trick
is to pass a pointer to the instance of the class (&ldquo;this&rdquo;) as the argument of
the worker, for example, called &ldquo;exec&rdquo;:
<PRE>
uthread = new std::thread(MyClassWithAThread::exec, this);
</PRE>
where <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">MyClassWithAThread</SPAN> is a class containing the static function &ldquo;exec&rdquo;:
<PRE>
class MyClassWithAThread {
        void run() {
                // ... hard work is done here
                doCallback(result); // hand the result over
        }
        static void exec(MyClassWithAThread* cppThread) {
                cppThread-&gt;run();
        }
}
</PRE>
which in turn then calls a non-static class method &ldquo;run()&rdquo; which
then has access to the instances variables.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00432000000000000000">
Lifetime of a thread</A>
</H2>
Threads terminate simply once the static worker has finished its job.
To tell the client that a thread has finished you can use a
<SPAN  CLASS="textsl">callback</SPAN> to trigger an event.

<P>
Sometimes it's important to wait for the termination of the thread,
for example when your whole program is terminating or when
you stop an endless loop in a thread. To wait for the termination
of the thread use the &ldquo;join()&rdquo; method:
<PRE>
        void stop() {
                uthread-&gt;join();
                delete uthread;
        }
</PRE>
Important is also to release the memory of a thread after it has finished
to avoid memory leaks.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00433000000000000000">
Running/stopping workers with endless loops</A>
</H2>
Threads with endless loops are often used in conjunction with blocking
I/O which provide the timing:
<PRE>
void run() {
       running = true;
       while (running) {
              read(buffer); // blocking
              doCallback(buffer); // hand data to client
       }
}
</PRE>
Note the flag &ldquo;running&rdquo; which is controlled by the main program and is set to zero to terminate
the thread:
<PRE>
        void stop() {
                running = false; // &lt;----- HERE!!
                uthread-&gt;join();
                delete uthread;
        }
</PRE>
Note that &ldquo;join()&rdquo; is a blocking operation and needs to be used with care not to
lock up the main program. You probably only need it when your program is terminating.
See <kbd><A ID="tex2html17"
  HREF="https://github.com/berndporr/rpi_AD7705_daq">https://github.com/berndporr/rpi_AD7705_daq</A></kbd> for an example.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00434000000000000000">
Timing within threads</A>
</H2>
Threads are perfect to create timing without using sleep commands
with the help of <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">blocking I/O</SPAN>.

<P>

<H3><A ID="SECTION00434100000000000000">
select/poll commands waiting for GPIO interrupts</A>
</H3>
In section&nbsp;<A HREF="node3.html#gpioIRQ">2.2.3</A> we introduced the so called &ldquo;poll&rdquo; command
which is not polling an IRQ pin but <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">putting a thread to sleep</SPAN> till an
external event has happened. Then of course a callback function should
be called reacting to the external event. This is the preferred method
for low latency responses.

<P>
As said previously, use <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">pigpio</SPAN> on the Raspberry PI
which wraps the select/poll commands into a thread and calls a
<SPAN  CLASS="textsl">callback</SPAN> function whenever an GPIO pin has been triggered.

<P>

<H3><A ID="SECTION00434200000000000000">
Timing with blocking I/O</A>
</H3>
Blocking I/O (read, write, etc) can be used to time
the data coming in because the thread goes to sleep when it's waiting for
I/O but wakes up very quickly after new data has arrived.

<P>
In this example the blocking &ldquo;read&rdquo; command creates
the timing of the callback:
<PRE>
void run() {
       running = 1;
       while (running) {
              read(buffer); // blocking
              doCallback(buffer); // hand data to client
       }
}
</PRE>

<P>

<H3><A ID="SECTION00434300000000000000">
Timing with Linux/pigpio timers</A>
</H3>
Similar to threads one can create timers which are called at certain
intervals. These timers emit a Linux signal at a specified interval
and then this signal is caught by a global (static) function.
Generally it's <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">not recommended</SPAN> to use timers for anything
which needs to be reliably sampled, for example ADC converters or
sensors with sampling rates higher than a few Hz. On the raspberry PI
use the pigpio library and its timer callbacks &ndash; if needed at all.
