Writing C++ device driver classes
</H1>
This chapter focuses on writing your own C++ device driver class
hiding away the complexity (and messy) low level C APIs and/or raw
device access. How are events translated into I/O operations? On the
hardware-side we have event signals such as data-ready signals or by
the timing of a serial or audio interface. The Linux kernel translates
this timing info into blocking I/O on the pseudo filesystem <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">/dev</SPAN>
which means that a read operation blocks until data has arrived
or an event has happened. The task of a C++ programmer is
to hide this complexity and these quite different approaches in C++
classes which communicate via callbacks and setters with the client
classes. The rest of the program will then appear simple and be
easy to maintain.

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION00310000000000000000">
General recommendations on how to write your C++ classes for devices</A>
</H1>
As said above the main purpose of object oriented coding here is to
hide away the complexity of low level driver access and offer the
client a simple and safe way of connecting to the sensor. In
particular:

<OL>
<LI>Setters and callbacks hand over <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">physical units</SPAN>
  (temperature, acceleration, ...) or relative units but not raw
  integer values with no meaning.
</LI>
<LI>The sensor is configured by specifying physical units (time,
  voltage, temperature) and not sensor registers. Default config parameters
  should be specified that the class can be used straight away with
  default parameters.
</LI>
<LI>The class comes with simple demo programs demonstrating how
  a client program might use it.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION00320000000000000000">
Callbacks in C++ device classes</A>
</H1>
As said in the introduction your hardware device class has callback interfaces
to hand back the data to the client.

<P>
There are different ways of tackling the issue of callbacks but the
simplest one is defining a method as <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">abstract</SPAN> and asking the
client to implement it in a derived class. That abstract function can
either be in a separate interface class or part of the device class
itself. So, we have two options:

<OL>
<LI>The callback is part of the device driver class:
<PRE>
class MyDriver {
          void start(DevSettings settings = DevSettings() );
          void stop();
          virtual void callback(float sample) = 0;
};
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>The callback is part of an interface class:
<PRE>
class CallbackInterface {
          virtual void callback(float sample) = 0;
};
</PRE>
and then registering it in the main device driver class:
<PRE>
class MyDriver {
          void registerCallback(CallbackInterface* cb);
};
</PRE>
</LI>
</OL>
These two options are now explained in greater detail.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00321000000000000000">
Creating a callback interface</A>
</H2>
Here, we create a separate interface class containing a callback
as an abstract method:
<PRE>
class LSM9DS1callback {
public:
        virtual void hasSample(LSM9DS1Sample sample) = 0;
};
</PRE>

<P>
The client then implements the abstract method <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">hasSample()</SPAN>, instantiates
the interface class and then saves its pointer in the device class, here called <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">lsm9ds1Callback</SPAN>.
<PRE>
void LSM9DS1::dataReady() {
        LSM9DS1Sample sample;
        // fills the sample struct with data
        // ...
        lsm9ds1Callback-&gt;hasSample(sample);
}
</PRE>
The pointer to the interface instance is transmitted via a setter which
receives the pointer of the interface as an argument, for example:
<PRE>
void LSM9DS1::registerCallback(LSM9DS1callback* cb);
</PRE>
This allows to register a callback optionally. The client may or may not need
one.
See
<kbd><A ID="tex2html3"
  HREF="https://github.com/berndporr/rpi_AD7705_daq">https://github.com/berndporr/rpi_AD7705_daq</A></kbd>for a complete example.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00322000000000000000">
Adding directly an abstract method to the device driver class</A>
</H2>
Instead of creating a separate class containing the callback you
can also add the callback straight to the device driver class.
<PRE>
class ADS1115rpi {
        ...
        virtual void hasSample(float sample) = 0;
        ...
};
</PRE>
This forces the client to implement the callback to be able to use
the class. This creates a very safe environment as all dependencies
are set at compile time and the abstract nature of the base class
makes clear what needs to be implemented.
See
<kbd><A ID="tex2html4"
  HREF="https://github.com/berndporr/rpi_ads1115">https://github.com/berndporr/rpi_ads1115</A></kbd> for a complete example.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00323000000000000000">
Callback arguments</A>
</H2>
Above the callbacks just delivered one floating point value. However,
often more than one sample or more complex data are transmitted:

<UL>
<LI>Complex data: do not put loads of arguments into the
  callback but define a <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">struct</SPAN>. For example an ADC might
  deliver all 4 channels at once:
<PRE>
class ADmulti {

        struct ADCSample {
            float ch1;
            float ch2;
            float ch3;
            float ch4;
        };

        ...
        virtual void hasSample(ADCSample sample) = 0;
        ...
};
</PRE>
Depending on your application,
you might consider the values not useful individually and therefore prefer
a <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">std::tuple</SPAN>.
</LI>
<LI>Arrays: Use arrays which contain the length of the arrays:
  either std::array, std::vector, etc or const arrays and then
  references to these so that the callback knows the length.
  For example the LIDAR callback uses a reference to a const length
  array:
<PRE>
/**
 * Callback interface which needs to be implemented by the user.
 **/
struct DataInterface {
        virtual void newScanAvail(
                float rpm, 
                A1LidarData (&amp;)[A1Lidar::nDistance]) = 0;
};
</PRE>
Here <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">A1Lidar::nDistance</SPAN> is a constant-expression giving the fixed array length,
and <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">(&amp;)[A1Lidar::nDistance]</SPAN> a reference to a constant-length array which
containing <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">A1LidarData</SPAN> stucts. If you're going to use types that hard to key-in
often, <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">typedef</SPAN> them.
</LI>
</UL>
In terms of <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">memory management</SPAN>:

<OL>
<LI>Low sampling rate complex data structures: allocate as a local variable. It can be a simple type
  or a struct. See <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">dataReady()</SPAN> in: <kbd><A ID="tex2html5"
  HREF="https://github.com/berndporr/LSM9DS1_RaspberryPi_CPP_Library/blob/master/LSM9DS1.cpp">https://github.com/berndporr/LSM9DS1_RaspberryPi_CPP_Library/blob/master/LSM9DS1.cpp</A></kbd>.
</LI>
<LI>High sampling rate buffers: allocate memory on the heap in the
  constructor or in the private section of the class as a const length
  array and pass on a <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">reference</SPAN>. See <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">getData()</SPAN> in

Low level userspace device access</A>
</H1>
The following sections provide pointers of how to write
the C++ driver classes for different hardware protocols.

<P>
To emulate an &ldquo;interrupt&rdquo; or event in userspace we need blocking I/O which provides the timing for example
when waiting for a GPIO change, doing audio or video I/O.

<P>
Generally any userspace program talks to the kernel via pseudo files in the <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">/dev</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">/sys</SPAN>

<BR>

</H3>
Reading from a video camera is usually done with the help of openCV which
in turn then talks to the low level C API which in turn talks to the kernel
via <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">/dev/video*</SPAN>.
<PRE>
while(running) {
    cv::Mat cap;
    videoCapture.read(cap);

</PRE>
The <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">read(cap)</SPAN> command is blocking till a new frame has

to the client. The full code of the example camera class is here:

<H3><A ID="SECTION00331200000000000000">
Raspberry PI</A>
</H3>
On the raspberry PI a new video stack has been implemented which talks
to the kernel via <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">/dev/media*</SPAN>. This is incompatible with
openCV and the code in section&nbsp;<A HREF="#videodesk">2.3.1</A> won't work. The good
news is that <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">libcamera</SPAN> already implements a callback
interface so a loop is no longer needed. Instead, one just needs to register a
callback to receive the video frames. The bad news is that libcamera
is highly complex and requires a lot of additional code
(<kbd><A ID="tex2html8"

To make life easier we have written a C++ wrapper around the libcamera C++ API
which exposes a callback which delivers image frames in openCV format to
mimick the behaviour of the openCV code of the previous
section&nbsp;<A HREF="#videodesk">2.3.1</A>:

</H2>
The standard framework for audio is alsa: <kbd><A ID="tex2html10"
  HREF="https://github.com/alsa-project">https://github.com/alsa-project</A></kbd>.

<P>
ALSA is packet based with a read command
returning a chunk ("buffer") of audio and write emitting one.
There are calls to set the sample format, sample rate, buffer size
and so forth.

<P>
First, the parameters are requested and the driver can modify or
reject them:
<PRE>
/* Signed 16-bit little-endian format */
  snd_pcm_hw_params_set_format(handle, params,
                               SND_PCM_FORMAT_S16_LE);

  /* One channel (mono) */
  snd_pcm_hw_params_set_channels(handle, params, 1);

  /* 44100 bits/second sampling rate (CD quality) */
  val = 44100;
  snd_pcm_hw_params_set_rate_near(handle, params,
                                  &amp;val, &amp;dir);
</PRE>

<P>
Then playing sound is done in an endless loop were a read()
or write() command is issued. Both are blocking so that
they guarantee event timing of audio both way.

<P>
<PRE>
 while (running) {
   if ((err = snd_pcm_readi (handle, buffer, buffer_frames)) != buffer_frames) {
     if (errCallback) errCallback-&gt;hasError();
   }
   if (sampleCallback) sampleCallback-&gt;hasData(buffer);
 }

The GPIO (of the raspberry PI) can easily be controlled via

<P>
When you use the gpiod library you:

<OL>
<LI>choose the I/O subsystem you want to use.
A subsystem is referred to as <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">chip</SPAN> dating back to when
each group of GPIO pins had their own physical device. Selection can be
made either by number, name or pseudo-file:
<PRE>
  struct gpiod_chip *chip =

</PRE>

</LI>
<LI>select a pin on the chip:
<PRE>
  struct gpiod_line *pinRed =
             gpiod_chip_get_line(chip, 24);
</PRE>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<H3><A ID="SECTION00334200000000000000">

as an output pin, with:
<PRE>
gpiod_line_request_output(pinRed, "example1", 0);
</PRE>
and set its value with:
<PRE>
gpiod_line_set_value(pinRed, 1);
</PRE>

<P>

<H3><A ID="SECTION00334300000000000000">
Events</A>
</H3>
Blocking I/O is very good for event processing.
Calling a blocking I/O function causes the thread
to wait efficiently, then
when the I/O call returns, the thread will wake up.
This means that a change in level from low to high or high
to low unblocks an I/O operation, awakening its underlying
thread which then performs a callback.

<P>
To request event processing on a pin simply
requires this single
command:
<PRE>
int ret =
   gpiod_line_request_rising_edge_events(pinSwitch, "Consumer1");
</PRE>
This will turn the GPIO pin <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">pinSwitch</SPAN> into an input pin and enable
blocking I/O on this pin.

<P>
Then start a thread where its worker contains:
<PRE>
void worker() {
    while (running) {
        constexpr struct timespec ts = { 1, 0 };
        gpiod_line_event_wait(pinSwitch, &amp;ts);
        struct gpiod_line_event event;
        gpiod_line_event_read(pinSwitch, &amp;event);
        event_callback();
    }
}
</PRE>
The <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">gpiod_line_event_wait</SPAN> waits for a rising edge at the GPIO
pin, or for 1&nbsp;second (+ 0&nbsp;ns), whichever is longer, and then unblocks.
The return value is 1 if a GPIO event occurred, 0 if timeout interval
was exceeded, and -1 in the event of an error. In production code,
you'd need to check this return value.
Then <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">gpiod_line_event_read</SPAN> transfers the
kernel event to userspace and clears it out of the kernel event queue.
It's important to do the read operation
even if the event-struct is never used. The callback is made,
and the loop repeats until another thread requrests termination
by setting <code>running</code> to <code>false</code>.

SPI is a protocol which usually transmits and receives at the same
time. Its calls are blocking for the duration of receive and transmit but cannot be used for
event based processing. If an SPI device is used events should be transmitted via an additional
GPIO line. 
Even though data might not be used it needs to be matched up,
because the same clock is used to send and collect the data signal
(it is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">isochronous</SPAN>).
So if you send 8 bytes the hardware receives 8 bytes at the same time.

<P>
Transfer to/from SPI is best managed by the low level access to <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">/dev</SPAN>.
Open the SPI device with the standard <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">open()</SPAN> function:
<PRE>
int fd = open( "/dev/spidev0.0", O_RDWR);
</PRE>

<P>
Then set the SPI mode (see table&nbsp;<A HREF="#spimodes">2.1</A>):
<PRE>
int ret = ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_WR_MODE, &amp;mode);
</PRE>
as explained, for example, here:
<kbd><A ID="tex2html14"
  HREF="https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/introduction-to-spi-interface.html">https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/introduction-to-spi-interface.html</A></kbd>.

<P>
Because SPI is isochronous, <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">read()</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">write()</SPAN>
can't be used to transmit and receive data. Instead, the simultaneous
read and write is performed using an <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">ioctl()</SPAN> to do the communication.
Populate this struct:
<PRE>
struct spi_ioc_transfer tr {
  .tx_buf = (unsigned long)tx1,
  .rx_buf = (unsigned long)rx1,
  .len = ARRAY_SIZE(tx1),
  .delay_usecs = delay,
  .speed_hz = speed,
  .bits_per_word = 8,
};
</PRE>
which points to two character buffers &ldquo;tx&rdquo; and &ldquo;rx&rdquo; with the
same length<A ID="tex2html15"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot171"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A>.

<P>
Reading and simultaneous writing then happens via this <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">ioctrl()</SPAN>
function call:
<PRE>
int ret = ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_MESSAGE(1), &amp;tr);
</PRE>

<P>
Sometimes the SPI protocol of a chip is so odd that even the raw I/O
via <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">/dev</SPAN> won't work and you need to write your own bit
banging interface, for example done here for the ADC on the alphabot:
<kbd><A ID="tex2html16"
  HREF="https://github.com/berndporr/alphabot/blob/main/alphabot.cpp#L58">https://github.com/berndporr/alphabot/blob/main/alphabot.cpp#L58</A></kbd>.
This is obviously far from ideal as it might require <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">usleep()</SPAN>
commands so that acquisition needs to be run in a separate thread (the
alphabot indeed uses a timer callback in a separate thread).

<P>
Overall the SPI protocol is often device dependent and calls
for experimentation to get it to work. On some ADCs the SPI clock is also
the conversion clock and a longer lasting clock signal sequence is required,
making it necessary to transmit dummy bytes in addition to the payload.

<P>
As a general recommendation do not use SAR converters which use the
SPI data clock also as acquisition clock as they are often not compatible
with the standard SPI transfers via <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">/dev</SPAN>. Use sensors or ADCs which
have their own clock signal.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00336000000000000000">
I2C</A>
</H2>
I2C is a protocol which either receives or transmits. Its calls are blocking for the duration of receive or transmit 
but only in rare cases can be used for event based processing. It is recommended to use an additonal GPIO pin for
events for example for a data-ready event.

<P>
The I2C bus has two signal lines (SDA &amp; SDL) which must be pulled up
by resistors. Every I2C device has an address on the bus. You can scan
a bus with <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">i2cdetect</SPAN> (part of the i2c-tools package):
<PRE>
root@raspberrypi:/home/pi# i2cdetect -y 1
     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
00:                         -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 1e -- 
20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 58 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 6b -- -- -- -- 
70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --                         
root@raspberrypi:/home/pi#
</PRE>
In this case there are 3 I2C devices on the I2C bus at addresses
1E, 58 and 6B and need to be specified when
accessing the I2C device.

<P>

<H3><A ID="SECTION00336100000000000000">
Raw <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">/dev/i2c</SPAN> access</A>
</H3>
I2C either transmits or receives but never at the same time so here we
can use the standard C read/write commands. However, we need to use ioctrl to tell
the kernel the I2C address:
<PRE>
char buf[2];
int file = open("/dev/i2c-2",O_RDWR);
int addr = 0x58;
ioctl(file, I2C_SLAVE, addr);
write(file, buf, 1)
read(file, buf, 2)
</PRE>
where <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">addr</SPAN> is the I2C address. Then use standard <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">read()</SPAN>
or <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">write()</SPAN> commands. Usually the 1st write operation tells the chip
which register to read or write to. Subsequent operations read
or write that register. For example, reading a 16&nbsp;bit register:
<PRE>
unsigned 2c_readWord(uint8_t reg)
{
	uint8_t tmp[2];
	tmp[0] = reg;
	write(fd_i2c,&amp;tmp,1);
        read(fd_i2c, tmp, 2);
        return (((unsigned)(tmp[0])) &lt;&lt; 8) | ((unsigned)(tmp[1]));
}
</PRE>
Similarly writing a 16&nbsp;bit register writes 3 bytes to the I2C bus (register and the 16&nbsp;bit data):
<PRE>
void i2c_writeWord(uint8_t reg, unsigned data)
{
	uint8_t tmp[3];
	tmp[0] = reg;
	tmp[1] = (char)((data &amp; 0xff00) &gt;&gt; 8);
	tmp[2] = (char)(data &amp; 0x00ff);
	write(fd_i2c,&amp;tmp,3);
}
</PRE>

Accessing physical memory locations (danger!)</A>
</H2>

<P>
Don't.
In case you really need to access registers you can
also access memory directly. This should only be used as a last resort.
For example, setting the clock for the AD converter requires
turning a GPIO pin into a clock output pin. This is not yet
supported by the drivers so we need to program registers
on the RPI.

<UL>
<LI>Linux uses virtual addresses so that a pointer won't
point to a physical memory location. It points to three page
tables with an offset.
</LI>
<LI>Special device <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">/dev/mem</SPAN> allows access to physical
memory.
</LI>
<LI>The command <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mmap</SPAN> provides a pointer to a physical
address by opening <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">/dev/mem</SPAN>.
</LI>
<LI>Example:
<PRE>
int *addr;
if ((fd = open("/dev/mem", O_RDWR|O_SYNC)) &lt; 0 ) {
    printf("Error opening file. \n");
    close(fd);
    return (-1);
}
addr = (int *)mmap(0, num*STRUCT_PAGE_SIZE, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE,
            fd, 0x0000620000000000);
printf("addr: %p \n",addr);
printf("addr: %d \n",*addr);
</PRE>

Kernel driver programming</A>
</H1>
You can also create your own <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">/dev/mydevice</SPAN> in the <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">/dev</SPAN> filesystem
by writing a kernel driver and a matching userspace library. For
example the USB mouse has a driver in kernel space and translates
the raw data from the mouse into coordinates. However,
this is beyond the scope of this handout. If you want to embark
on this adventure then the best approach is to
find a kernel driver which does approximately what you want and
modify it for your purposes.

<H1><A ID="SECTION00350000000000000000">
Conclusion</A>
</H1>
The communication between C++ classes is achieved via
callbacks and setters. The event from the sensor traverses
the C++ classes via callbacks and then back to the control
output via setters.

<P>
From the sections above it's clear that Linux user-space low level
device access is complex, even without taking into account the
complexity of contemporary chips which have often a multitude of
registers and pages of documentation. Your task is to hide away
all this (scary) complexity in a C++ class and offer the client
an easy-to-understand interface.
