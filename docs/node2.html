<P>
In realtime embedded coding it's all about <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">events</SPAN>
which can be a binary signal as somebody opening a door or
an ADC signalling that a sample is ready.
Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="#timing">1.1</A> shows the basic dataflow and how event timing is
established: devices by themselves have event signals such as data
ready or crash sensor triggered. The Linux kernel then receives
interrupt callbacks. However, userspace has no direct interrupt
mechanism but it has blocking I/O where an I/O operation blocks
until an interrupt has happened. These can then be translated
back into callbacks between classes. Data is transmitted 
back to the hardware via methods called &ldquo;setters&rdquo;.

<P>

<TABLE>
<CAPTION class="BOTTOM"><STRONG>Figure 1.2:</STRONG>
A realtime system with two C++ classes. Communication
  between classes is achieved with callbacks (not getters) for incoming events
  and setters to send out control events. The control output itself
  receives its timing from the events so that the loop is traversed
  as quickly as possible.

Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="#gettersetters">1.2</A> shows the overall communication between C++
classes in a realtime system. This communication is done via callbacks
(<SPAN  CLASS="textsl">not</SPAN> getters) and setters, where an event from a sensor
traverses according to its realtime requirements through the classes via
callbacks and then back to the control output via setters. For example,
a collision sensor at a robot triggers a GPIO pin, which then triggers a
callback to issue an avoidance action which in turn then sets the
motors in reverse.

<P>
When developing the C++ classes keep S.O.L.I.D.
<kbd><A ID="tex2html3"
  HREF="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design</A></kbd>in mind:

<OL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textsl">Single responsibility</SPAN>: If you have a temperature
sensor and an accelerometer then write two classes, one for the
temperature sensor and one of the accelerometer. Don't write one
class <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">Hardware</SPAN> which takes an argument <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">Hardware::temp</SPAN>
or <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">Hardware::accel</SPAN> and then does one of two completely different
things. It's a debugging nightmare.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textsl">Open-Closed principle</SPAN> Your class is open to extension but
  closed to modification. For example an ADC class
  has a callback which returns voltage to the client. However,
  you'll be connecting, for example, a temperature sensor to
  it, so you'd like to be able to extend the class
  overloading the callback methods so that you add the conversion
  from volt to degrees. This is a Good Thing<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> so long as
  you create a derived class. It's a bad idea to hack the existing
  ADC class adding a <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">to_kelvin</SPAN> method: why would somebody
  using the ADC to read a value from an accelerometer need that?
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textsl">Liskov substitution principle</SPAN> Strictly, subtituting
  a derived class for its base class does not result in the program
  becoming incorrect. That is to say, any derived class from
  your device driver class can be used in place of the base class if
  the base class is all that's required, because the extra
  functionality in the derived class shouldn't break the basic
  required functionality of the base class. For example, if you have a
  super duper DAC with lots of extra features, it shouldn't stop you
  using it when you only need a very simple one. This also means
  that sensible default values should be set so that the client
  won't need to understand the nerdy features of that super duper DAC.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textsl">Interface Segregation Principle</SPAN>:
  Keep functionality separate and rather divide it up in different
  classes. Imagine you have a universal IO class with SPI and I2C
  but your client really just needs SPI. Then the client is forced
  to deactivate I2C or in the worst case the class causes collateral
  damage without the client knowing why.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textsl">Dependency inversion</SPAN>: That is about obstructing the
  essential features of of a class of interfaces. For example, ideally
  you want a base class covering a range of similar
  ADC converters from the same manufacturer and not a base class being
  a driver for a particular chip. Individual ADC chip driver
  classes then inherit from the abstract ADC driver. The authors of
  the ADC's driver will no doubt consider their chip's
  particular capabilities to be the core ideas,
  but this needs inverting. Why would one ADC driver need
  to provide all the necessaray code for a different one of the
  same family? Instead, the driver is dependent on the abstract
  idea of an ADC, not the other way around.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Besides S.O.L.I.D it's also essential that:

<OL>
<LI>the project has a <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">build system</SPAN> such as cmake. It's strongly recommended to use cmake
  (autoconf only for older existing projects).
</LI>
<LI>classes (in particular driver classes) are <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">re-usable</SPAN>
  outwith of the specific project and have
  their own &ldquo;cmake&rdquo; projects in their subdirectories. Except for the main
  cmake project all sub-projects are libraries.
</LI>
<LI>all public interfaces have <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">doc-strings</SPAN> for all public methods/constants and
  an automatically generated reference, for example with the help of doxygen.
</LI>
<LI>classes which perform internal processing such as filters, databases, detectors, ...have
  <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">unit tests</SPAN> and run via &ldquo;ctest&rdquo;.
</LI>
<LI>the documentation provides comprehensive information about the project itself,
  how to install and run the project.
</LI>
