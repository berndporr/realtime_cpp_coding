Event based coding in the Linux userspace</A>
</H1>

<P>
Realtime embedded coding is all about <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">events</SPAN>.
These can be a binary signal such as somebody opening a door or
an ADC signalling that a sample is ready to be picked up.
Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="#timing">1.1</A> shows the basic dataflow and how event timing is
established: devices by themselves have event signals such as &ldquo;data
ready&rdquo; or &ldquo;crash sensor has been triggered&rdquo;. The Linux kernel receives
these as interrupt callbacks. However, userspace has no direct interrupt
mechanism; instead it has blocking I/O where a read or write operation blocks
until a kernel-side interrupt has happened. A blocking I/O call returning
may then be translated callbacks between classes by waking up threads.
Data is transmitted back to the hardware via methods called &ldquo;setters&rdquo;,
which change an object's attributes and potentially do other processing.

<P>

<DIV class="CENTER"><A ID="gettersetters"></A><A ID="367"></A>
<TABLE>
<CAPTION class="BOTTOM"><STRONG>Figure 1.2:</STRONG>
A realtime system with two C++ classes. Communication
  between classes is achieved with callbacks (not getters) for incoming events
  and setters to send out control events. The control output itself
  receives its timing from the events so that the loop is traversed
  as quickly as possible.

</TABLE>
</DIV>
Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="#gettersetters">1.2</A> shows the overall communication between C++
classes in a realtime system. This communication is done via <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">callbacks</SPAN>
(<SPAN  CLASS="textsl">not</SPAN> getters) and setters, where an event from a sensor
traverses according to its realtime requirements through the C++ classes via
callbacks and then back to the control output via setters. For example,
a collision sensor at a robot triggers a GPIO pin, which then triggers a
callback to issue an avoidance action which in turn then sets the
motors in reverse.

<P>
Callbacks can be seen as userspace interrupt service routines.
These must always complete immediately so that the caller is
not experience any noticeable delay. For example when a user
presses a button in a GUI the callback must be
processed without any noticeable delay which is application specific.
If processing takes
longer then a thread should be started which in turn then will
then have a callback signalling success.

<P>
In the following sections we are describing how to write event driven
code in C++. Important here is the interplay between blocking I/O and
threads: chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node3.html#drivers">2</A> focuses on how to wrap the low
level blocking Linux I/O in a class and how to establish the
communication between classes while the chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node4.html#threads">3</A>
describes how threads can effectively be used to trigger callbacks
with blocking I/O. Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#qt">4</A> then presents the event based
communication in Qt, in particular user interaction and animations.
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node6.html#webserver">5</A> tackles the same issues as for Qt but for
website server communication. The final chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node7.html#setters">6</A> then
describes how events are transmitted back from a C++ class to the user
with the help of setters.
